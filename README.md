# SPIRV-LIT-Converter
Scripts converting LIT tests from SPIRV-LLVM-Translator format to LLVM-SPIRV-Backend format

## Description / Introduction

This is a set of Python+Bash scripts for half-automated process of conversion lit tests from [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator) format
to [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend) one, i.e. for automatization and simplifying most routine operations.

It's not ideal nor perfect, because some transformations cannot be converted automatically (and several shouldn't be, for one or another reason), so:

    Note: After running scripts on a test, the resulting test should be checked, reviewed and fixed manually
    (if necessary).

Moreover, it's not full, i.e. does not contain every instruction from [SPIR-V's ISA](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html) nor every possible values of its parameters -
but only that ones, that occurred in accepted lit tests (i.e. tests that are present both in [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/tree/master/test)
and [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/tree/feature/spirv-backend-llvm14/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV) repositories).

So, if new test is to be added with "new" instruction(s)/parameter(s), `synt.py` script should be extended. (See [Extension](#extension) below.)

## Details

Basically, to convert LLVM lit test from [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator) format to [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend),
following steps should be done (managed by main [`run.sh`](run.sh) script):

0. If source lit test is OpenCL (`.cl`), at first obtain lit test in LLVM (`.ll`) format:
    * 0.1. [`./cl_par.py`](cl_par.py) *test*.cl  
    --- get options to be passed to `clang`.
    * 0.2. `clang` -cc1 -nostdsysteminc -triple *spir* -cl-std=CL2.0 *...* -finclude-default-header -emit-llvm *test*.cl  
    --- compile source `.cl` file (using parameters obtained in previous step) and generate LLVM IR file (`.ll`).
        - *It's better to use `clang` built from [llvm-project/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) repository rather than from
        [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend) one due to better compliance of versions.*
    * 0.3. [`./cl2ll.py`](cl2ll.py) *test*.cl > *test.cl*.ll  
    --- make all OpenCL code as comments, convert all C-style comments (`//`) to LLVM-style (`;`) and remove `RUN: %clang_cc1` lit command.
    * 0.4. Combine two files *test*.ll and *test.cl*.ll, obtained in previous steps, into one *test*.ll.
1. [`./triple.py`](triple.py) *test.bak*.ll > *test.bak1*.ll  
--- change target triple from, e.g., `spir-unknown-unknown` to `spirv32-unknown-unknown`, or `spir64` to `spirv64-unknown-unknown` (without this it won't be compiled by `llc` ).
2. [`./strip.py`](strip.py) *test.bak1*.ll > *test.bak2*.ll  
--- search for `llvm-spirv -spirv-text`/`-to-text` and corresponding `FileCheck` "RUN" lit commands ("LLVM => SPIR-V" direction only, text format only, no extensions, etc),
replace all `RUN`s with single  
`RUN: llc -O0 %s -o - | FileCheck %s [...]`,  
collect list of "good" `FileCheck`'s prefixes (e.g. `CHECK` or `CHECK-SPIRV`),
which should be left in the test, and list of "bad" prefixes (e.g. `CHECK-LLVM`, `CHECK-SPV-IR`), and remove latter form the test,
because its won't be accepted by [`synt.py`](synt.py) in the next step.
    - *Note 1. [`strip.py`](strip.py) prints on stderr accepted `llvm-spirv`'s and `FileCheck`'s commands and "good" and "bad" lists (latter denoted with `' ! '`).
    If "good" list (accepted `FileCheck`'s prefixes) is empty, it returns non-zero exit code and empty stdout.*
    - *Note 2. In some rare cases, when prefix falls into both "good" and "bad" lists, or when prefix from one list starts with prefix from another
    (e.g. "good" `CHECK-SPIRV` and "bad" `CHECK-SPIRV-EXT` or `CHECK-SPV` and `CHECK-SPV-FPGA_REG`),
    [`strip.py`](strip.py) leaves these `FileCheck`'s prefixes in the test for the greater good. The resulting test should be reviewed more carefully and unwanted `FileCheck`'s commands removed manually (if decided).
    But usually [`strip.py`](strip.py) removes its automatically.
    This is not a bug, this is a feature. :-)*
3. [`./synt.py`](synt.py) *test.bak2*.ll > *test*.ll  
--- core conversion script --- process all remaining `FileCheck`'s commands, parse SPIR-V instructions, change its' syntax
(extract destination parameter (if any) and move it to left side of assignment) and format (add `%` to id parameters and convert literal parameters to corresponding  symbolic names, if necessary), etc.
    - *Note. [`synt.py`](synt.py) prints on stderr all `FileCheck`'s commands that it could not convert (not SPIR-V instruction or wrong format, new unknown SPIR-V instruction, etc...) and returns non-zero exit code,
    because this test highly likely won't be passed by `llvm-lit` in final step. Keep an eye on stderr to avoid following nuisances.*

Besides, for debugging purposes and convenience of comparison of source and target lit tests and corresponding SPIR-V codes, [`run.sh`](run.sh) executes following actions:

* `llvm-as` *test.bak*.ll  
--- *built from [llvm-project/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) repository* --- compile LLVM text IR to LLVM bitcode (`.bc`).
* `llvm-spirv` -spirv-text *test.bak*.bc  
--- *built from [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator) repository* --- convert LLVM bitcode to SPIR-V in an internal Translator's textual format (`.spt`, checked in source lit test).
* `llc` -O0 *test*.ll  
--- *built from [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend) repository* --- compile LLVM text IR (with converted lit commands and SPIR-V instructions) to SPIR-V assembler (`.s`, checked in target lit test).
* `llvm-lit` *-a* *test*.ll  
--- *built from [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend) repository* --- if all steps above completed successfully, finally run lit test.

Note. All *italicized* parameters/substrings above are given as examples and could vary.

## Prerequisites

Since [`run.sh`](run.sh) invokes many tools, in order to execute its, run and check test rather than simply blindly convert it, repositories should be not only checkout, but also built as well:

* For convenience put all SPIR-V things in one base directory, e.g. `~/spirv`:
```
mkdir ~/spirv && cd ~/spirv
```
* Checkout and build [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator) as [LLVM in-tree build](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#llvm-in-tree-build):
```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project/llvm/projects
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator.git
cd ../.. && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja ../llvm -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang"
# make llvm-spirv -j`nproc`
cmake --build . -- check-llvm-spirv
```
* Checkout and build [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend)
(taken from [SPIR-V Backend's Build and Testing Instructions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/blob/master/llvm/docs/SPIR-V-Backend.rst)):
```
cd ~/spirv
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend.git
cd LLVM-SPIRV-Backend && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="SPIRV" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" ../llvm
cmake --build . -- FileCheck count llvm-as llvm-config llvm-dis not clang llc llvm-dwarfdump llvm-objdump llvm-readelf
cd ..
build/bin/llvm-lit llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV
```

(Note. If you have no `.cl` tests, you can exclude `clang` from `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS` and `cmake --build` and use `clang` from
[llvm-project/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) repository.)

## Installing

Download [`triple.py`](triple.py), [`strip.py`](strip.py), [`synt.py`](synt.py), [`run.sh`](run.sh), [`cl_par.py`](cl_par.py), [`cl2ll.py`](cl2ll.py)
to [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/tree/feature/spirv-backend-llvm14/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV) test directory, for example.
*Or in some of it's subdirectories. Or in [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/tree/master/test) test (sub)directory, if it is conveniently.
In general, scripts can be placed anywhere,* but its all should reside in the same directory.
*And outside of test directory relative test paths are not supported, so use full absolute file names in that case.
So, taking into account that its create new and modify `.ll` files,* the most convenient place for its is
[LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/tree/feature/spirv-backend-llvm14/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV) test directory.
*In this case, relative short test names are supported as well.*

Open [`run.sh`](run.sh) in text editor and change `SPIRV_HOME`'s value in first line of code, if you place all your SPIR-V things in different directory rather than `~/spirv`
(alternatively, you can pass `SPIRV_HOME` environment variable before running [`run.sh`](run.sh)).
Also check other paths in heading of script and fix, if its don't match with yours.

## Running

Having changed working directory to [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/tree/feature/spirv-backend-llvm14/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV)
and downloaded scripts here, simply type, for example:
```
./run.sh read_image.cl
```
or:
```
./run.sh transcoding/OpMin.ll
```
You can also specify full absolute path to test (source or target - no matter, it will be taken from [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/tree/master/test)
test directory anyway):
```
./run.sh /home/user/spirv/llvm-project/llvm/projects/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/test/transcoding/OpMin.ll
./run.sh /home/user/spirv/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV/transcoding/OpMin.ll
```
If your paths are different from default and you don't want to change `SPIRV_HOME` environment variable in [`run.sh`](run.sh) script, alternatively, you can pass it from command line, e.g.:
```
SPIRV_HOME="/home/user/spirv" ./run.sh transcoding/OpMin.ll
```
If test didn't passed or `llvm-lit` didn't run at all and you get on stderr lines with ` ; CHECK...: ...` lit's commands (for e.g., as in `./run.sh simple.ll`),
you have to manually fix the test (e.g., by removing extra `CHECK`s that are not SPIR-V instructions) or extend [`synt.py`](synt.py) otherwise.

## Parameters

There is possibility not to run all of the steps mentioned above, but only selected ones, or switch off some steps, or start from specified step.  
To run only one specified step, pass any of `cl`, `spt`, `tri`, `strip`, `synt`, `llc`, `lit` additional parameter next after file name, e.g.:
```
./run.sh select.ll tri
```
will copy source lit test from [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/tree/master/test) and launch only [`triple.py`](triple.py) script.  
Then, to continue to process all remaining phases, pass next step as additional parameter with extra symbol at the end (e.g., `.`):
```
./run.sh select.ll strip.
```
(This available only for `tri.`, `strip.`, `synt.` and `llc.` stages.)  
This "step's enabling" parameter (if any) should be first additional one (next after file name) and before "steps' disabling" parameter(s) (if any).  
To disable executing one or more steps, specify it with prepending `-` symbol, e.g. to switch off generating unneeded source and target assembler files (`.spt` and `.s`):
```
./run.sh select.ll -spt -llc
```
"Enabling" and "disabling" parameters can be combined, but "enabling" first, e.g.:
```
./run.sh select.ll strip. -llc -lit
```
There is possibility to run converted `.cl` lit test in its source `.cl` format rather that in `.ll` one:
```
./run.sh read_image.cl cl
./run.sh read_image.cl lit
```

## Error codes

If any of invoked tools or scripts is failed, [`run.sh`](run.sh) returns corresponding error code.  
In addition, it returns `3` if `.bak` file for given test is detected (i.e., test is already processed, so, to convert test again simply delete that `.bak`);  
and `2` is also returned by [`strip.py`](strip.py) if test is unaccepted (only `CHECK`s for "SPIR-V => LLVM" direction, or some extension is used, etc).
In this case displaying the list of rejected `CHECK`s on stderr is turned off (for simplifying of generating the list of accepted only tests),
but this behavior can easily be changed by moving condition `if len(Checks_OK) ? 0:` to `sys.exit(2)` in [`strip.py`](strip.py) script.

## Extension

There is no single word to describe it. Some knowledge of [SPIR-V's ISA](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html),
[SPIRV-LLVM-Translator's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/tree/master/test) internal textual format,
how [LLVM-SPIRV-Backend's](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/LLVM-SPIRV-Backend/tree/feature/spirv-backend-llvm14/llvm/test/CodeGen/SPIRV) assembler should look like,
syntax of [llvm-lit's](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html) `CHECK` commands
and of course understanding of implementation of [`synt.py`](synt.py) is required. So, it's better to ask the author to add new instruction(s).  
But in general, at first find this new instruction in [SPIR-V's ISA](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html) and figure out at which position it's
destination parameter is. There can be no destination at all (e.g., [OpBranch](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpBranch)),
or at first parameter (mostly, various types, e.g., [OpTypeBool](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpTypeBool))
or, most common case, at second parameter (e.g., [OpFAdd](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpFAdd) - see underlined `Result <id>`).
Then add this instruction (without `Op` prefix) somewhere to `DEST0`, `DEST1` or `DEST2` list correspondingly at the beginning of [`synt.py`](synt.py) script.
If all of the parameters of instruction are `id`s (i.e., should be preceded with `%`, as in [OpFAdd](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpFAdd)),
that's all - the work is done.  
Otherwise, an exception from common converting rule should be programmed for this instruction (or latter should be added to existing one).
For example, if instruction has `Literal` parameter(s) (e.g., [OpName](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpName)), it should be added to
`LIT` map with specifying its position(s) (`n` counting from `1`, but starting next to destination `Result <id>` parameter) closer to the bottom of [`synt.py`](synt.py) script.
If parameter has "named" type (e.g., [Memory_Operands](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#Memory_Operands) in [OpLoad](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SPIR-V/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#OpLoad)),
then the instruction should be added to corresponding id_number-to-name map (existing, if any, or created new one). Moreover, additional care about possible parameter's values should be taken:
if there is no such value(s), it should be added too.
